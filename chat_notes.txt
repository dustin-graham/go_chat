Issues to handle:
how do I handle client disconnections? I want to be able to clean up the client references when the client disconnects.

Features to add:
a request help feature: type in //help and get a prompt that tells you how to use the chat service

channels?
It may be interesting to have a single channel for each room and then be able to message all clients through the channel rather than looping over members and sending message
- when a client joins a room we'd need to switch which channel they listen to
- when a client sends a message it would need to process that message and respond to commands but then forward messages to the room's channel

Deployment?
We could dockerize it

Testing?
how to test something like this, we'll need to look into go's test tools to see if we can connect and communicate between server and client

Organization?
- how to make the code clean and easy to read, more maintainable. maybe something like handler functions for different commands?
