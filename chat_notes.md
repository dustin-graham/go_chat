Testing
The main omission here is testing. If I were to spend any more time with this I'd stop adding features and focus just on testing end-to-end functionality. I didn't do this up front because I was a bit unsure about what the overall shape of the solution. Now that I've got a firmer picture in my mind I'd go back and rework things and build up a test platform for future development. I've used the `httptest` package before. It's fantastic for testing APIs. I'm a bit unsure of how to use it to simulate the telnet interactions (perhaps not entirely necessary), but that's where I'd start with building the test platform for this program.
